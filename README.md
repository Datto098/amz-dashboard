# Express.js API Project

This is a basic Express.js project scaffold for building APIs.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

## Project Structure
- `index.js`: Main entry point for the Express server
- `package.json`: Project metadata and dependencies

## Customize
Add your API routes in `index.js` or create new route files as needed.
